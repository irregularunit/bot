## Code Style
We follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code, but don't worry too much about it. Use common sense and aim for readability. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
- Avoid long lines (less than 79 characters).
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY).

If you have a good reason to break these conventions, do it!

- Update documentation as needed.
